Introduction to Machine Learning
================================

What is Machine Learning?
-------------------------
 
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of explicitly programming every rule, machine learning algorithms identify patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions.

At its core, machine learning is about answering questions like:
 
- Can we predict future trends based on historical data?
 
- Can we classify objects or events into categories?
 
- Can we detect anomalies or outliers in a dataset?

Here is a walkthrough video of DPI's own machine learning platform BluegIL:

Types of Machine Learning
-------------------------

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**  
   In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data comes with corresponding output labels. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.  
   Examples: Predicting house prices, classifying emails as spam or not spam.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given data without explicit labels. The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures in the data.  
   Examples: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.  
   Examples: Training robots, game-playing AI like AlphaGo.

Why is Machine Learning Important?
----------------------------------

Machine learning is transforming industries by enabling automation, improving decision-making, and uncovering insights from data. Here are some real-world applications:

- **Healthcare**: Predicting diseases, personalizing treatments.
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, stock market predictions.
- **Retail**: Recommendation systems, inventory optimization.
- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles, route optimization.

Key Concepts in Machine Learning
--------------------------------

1. **Features and Labels**  
   - Features: The input variables (e.g., age, income, etc.).
   - Labels: The output variable we want to predict (e.g., house price).

2. **Training and Testing**  
   - Training: The process of teaching the model using historical data.
   - Testing: Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

3. **Overfitting and Underfitting**  
   - Overfitting: When the model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.
   - Underfitting: When the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
