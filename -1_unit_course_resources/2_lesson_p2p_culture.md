# Peer-to-peer Learning Culture ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›

Welcome to our culture of peer-to-peer learning! âœ¨ We're excited to embark on this learning journey with you - one where we all grow together, not just as software developers but as invaluable contributors to each other's learning process.

Here's why this experience is going to be rewarding:

- **Teach to learn**: Did you know that we remember 90% of what we teach? Compare that to the 5-10% from just reading or listening! When you teach, you're not just helping others; you're helping yourself cement this knowledge. So, whenever you're able, lend a hand in teaching; it benefits the whole community!
- **Build communication skills**: Tech industry isn't all about coding alone; it's about sharing and explaining problems and ideas. When learning with others, you'll sharpen your skills in articulating complex issues and collaborating on solutionsâ€”just what the real world demands.
- **Relationships motivate**: Building relationships here means more than just better learning; it's about supporting each other, increasing our motivation, and accountability. This isn't just school; this is your tribe.
- **Help even if you're not sure**: Don't know if you can help your peer? We encourage you to try! Sometimes, finding the solution with your peers, even when none of you knows it at the outset, makes learning exciting and less lonely. If you stay stuck, just reach out to an instructor for help.
- **The goal is comprehension**: Got an answer from a peer? Great! But don't stop there. Ask "Why?" and "How?" until you truly get it. Challenge every answer for your own clarity!

If you haven't already, pop over to the Discord "Introduce-yourself" channel and let's get the introductions rolling. Don't forget to also say hello ðŸ‘‹ to your peers who've already introduced themselves. This is more than just saying "Hi"; it's about building the first bridge with your peers and maybe, friends for life (as we've often seen with DPI graduates ðŸ˜‰)! We'll use Discord to grow our peer learning community, so be sure to stay signed in and active on Discord as much as possible.
