What is Data Science?
=====================

Data Science means a lot of things to a lot of different people. However, there are three fundamental bits to Data
Science that transcends all definitions of Data Science:

1. Data Science is **computation**, where you use computer-based tools to help explore data.

2. Data Science is **inference**, where you use statistical methods to help understand trends in data.

3. Data Science is **business intelligence**, where you gain actionable knowledge from the exploration of data.

Thinking of Data Science as the combination of computation, inferential thinking, and business intelligence allows us to
use all three of these tools to make decisions under uncertainty. Computation, or computer science, allows us to use
programming to handle massive amounts of data and analyze it easily.  
This is an amazing alternative to analyzing by hand!

Inferential thinking, or statistics, is a tool that allows us to use the data to make better decisions. Statistics helps
us understand the past and make predictions about the future.

Lastly, business intelligence allows us to use domain-specific knowledge to communicate our data science results to
those who are not technical.

In this course, we will be teaching **YOU** how to be a data scientist! Step 1 of becoming a data scientist is to learn
and understand the foundational computational and statistical skills, so that you can communicate your conclusions with
the rest of the world!

Data Scientists are found everywhere. Almost all sectors, including finance, healthcare, and software have HUGE amounts
of data and need someone who has the skills to work with, analyze, draw conclusions, and communicate about this data to
drive business forward.

Data science is one of the most powerful tools we have today to understand the world! Welcome to DISCOVERY! It's been
waiting for you!
